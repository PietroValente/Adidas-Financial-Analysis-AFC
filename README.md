## Overview
 I gained a deep understanding of financial analysis and reporting techniques, as well as their impact on the overall performance of a for-profit enterprise. This knowledge enabled me to complete a financial analysis project on Adidas, in which I compared the company's financial performance to its competitors, Nike and Puma.

Through the course, I learned about the role of the "Accounting, Finance & Control" organizational unit within a company, as well as its evolution over time. I also gained a solid understanding of financial accounting concepts, including the consolidation of financial statements for corporate groups. This knowledge was crucial for my project, as I was able to analyze Adidas' consolidated financial statements and gain insight into the company's financial position.

In addition to financial accounting, I also learned about performance measurement and reporting techniques, including accounting-based performance measures and value-based indicators. This knowledge allowed me to assess Adidas' financial performance against its competitors and identify areas for improvement.

Throughout the project, I was able to design a tailored performance measurement system for Adidas, taking into account the company's goals and organizational structure. I prepared performance reports that were tailored to the information needs of different stakeholders, and was able to interpret the financial (and non-financial) performance of Adidas and its constituencies.

Overall, the "Accounting, Finance & Control" course provided me with the theoretical frameworks and practical tools necessary to conduct a thorough financial analysis of Adidas and make informed recommendations for the company's future financial strategy.
